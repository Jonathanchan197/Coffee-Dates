# Coffee Date
You can try **Coffee Date** [here](https://main--stunning-entremet-0abbec.netlify.app)!

Coffee Date is a simple web app to connect people with experienced mentors in their industry. It uses a fun swiping system so potential mentees can easily request contact with mentors of their choice. Chatrooms are only created upon the mentor's approval, and from there, both parties can arrange their first coffee date!
